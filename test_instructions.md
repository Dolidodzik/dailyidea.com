Hi, You've received this as a test in order to potentially work together.

This is intended as a way for us to evaluate folks we are compatible to work with.

It's not long and it can be done in your free time. You can spend up to 90 minutes on it, and
you can spend as little time (even zero!) on it if you want.

Please don't spend more than that -- as it's not intended to suck up your time, and it's not
for us to source "free work" (this is sample work on a real codebase, but will not be used
 other than for evaluation).

Before you start, you should let me know when you plan to do this and when you plan to respond with
a committed branch for us to review. This is just so I can plan and know when to expect a response.

1. fork the repository https://github.com/ezl/dailyidea.com/ and checkout branch "test"
2. if you need an env file to deploy, you may use front/conf/example.env - rename this to local.env locally
3. work through the tickets in https://github.com/ezl/dailyidea.com/projects/2, column "test"
4. you may spend up to, but not longer than 90 minutes working through the tickets, in the list order from top to bottom. You may choose how long you spend on it, depending on what you think will provide me the most representative evaluation of your work output and skill.
5. Use separate, clearly labeled commits for different tasks and identify which tickets they are related to.
6. Issue a pull request back to your own forked branch with the changes for this test.

Then, send me:

- a link to the pull request.
- let me know how long you spent and which tickets were completed
- notes on what you thought -- easy parts, hard parts, good/bad things about the codebase, what you would change -- anything you think is relevant

I'll be evaluating you for a few things: output vs time spent, code quality/organization, communication
